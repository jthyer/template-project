# template-project
Basic template project for making games with Love2D and Ogmo.

To Do:
- I want easy simple animation and sprite switching. This should be handled at the parent object level.
- Spikes. Player should be able to hit spikes and enemies and die.
- Implement remaining jellyfish and bullets.

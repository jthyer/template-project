# template-project
Basic template project for making games with Love2D and Ogmo.

To Do:
- I want easy simple animation and sprite switching. This should be handled at the parent object level. Maybe asset.sprite should be tables containing frame and image speed data?
- Spikes. Player should be able to hit spikes and enemies and die.
- Implement remaining jellyfish and bullets.
- Very simple title screen, move between three stages, very simple ending. Do the title in-engine, like Game Maker.
- Can still clip into corners. Do looping collision check to make sure player doesn't get stuck?
